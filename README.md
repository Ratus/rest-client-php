# Ratus / rest-client-php

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ratus/rest-client-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ratus/rest-client-php)

-----

Sick of having to write completely new API handlers for each new RESTful API?

This rest client takes a bit of the pain away by providing the most commonly-used functionality, providing a useful set of classes you can extend to customize the behavior.
